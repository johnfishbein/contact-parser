Contact Converter: Convert Spreadsheet with first name, last name, email, and phone number
to a contact file that can be instantly turned into Apple contacts.

To use, run the following command
python3 contact_parser.py -i {csv}
where {csv} is replaced with the path to the csv file you wish to convert.

This will create an apple vCard file with all contacts. Optionally, you may rename the output vCard file using the -o command line argument.
